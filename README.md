### Welcome , This is my Web Developer Portfolio

## Technologies:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**

## Project Goals:

## `  This project will be my main portfolio, where it will show my skills and knowledge to my future employers. For this project, i will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where i can share the projects that i build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that i built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out me. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.`

## Project Objectives:

1. **All HTML will reside in index.html**
2. **Do not use CDNs – all code must reside within the project**
3. **All JS and CSS must be in dedicated files (eg, app.js/ style.css). Do not include embedded or inline JS, CSS or use element methods such as -**
   ```
        <select onchange="myFunction()">
   ```
4. **All JavaScript should be in one file for ease of maintenance and reviewing**
5. **jQuery must only read and update attributes of existing elements. It must not be used to render HTML except where processes iteratively populate controls such as select tags or tables.**
6. **PHP is to be used for data acquisition from:**
    ```
    1.  Local files on the server
    2.  Remote APIs
    3.  Databases (MySQL/MariaDB)
   ```
7. **PHP will return JSON to the client. Under no circumstances must it return any type of HTML**
8. **Preferably a single page application (SPA) to ensure smooth operation on mobiles**
9.  **Employing a framework such as Bootstrap is highly desirable as it reduces the development time and, if used in conjunction with one of the many freely available templates, will ensure a professional appearance. Please do not use WordPress or other content management systems (CMS)**
10. **The menu should navigate to the following sections:**
```
    1. Profile
    2. Skills
    3. Experience
    4. Links to portfolio projects
    5. Contact form
```
